# mojo.nvim — TODO

> Priorities are based on AGENTS.md sovereignty rules. P0 = blocks sovereignty.

## Workflow Rules

1. **One branch per task** — each item below is done in a separate branch from `main`. No mixing concerns.
2. **No commits without request** — never commit unless I explicitly ask.
3. **Merge then next** — once tested and committed, merge to `main`, then start the next task on a fresh branch.

## P1 — Missing Infrastructure

### 4. Add test infrastructure and initial tests

Deferred until core features stabilize and the plugin API solidifies.

### 5. Add CI configuration

Deferred until test infrastructure (P1 #4) is in place.

## P2 — Quality & Completeness

### 13. Support popular Neovim tools with README documentation

**Scope:** Ongoing — new tools are added here as they're identified.
